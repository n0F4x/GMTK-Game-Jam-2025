# Stuck in yesterday

## Story
Youre trying to make it past the demon waves, because you got cursed by some cigan, because youre so selfish and mean person. Each time you die, you will wake up again. Tomorrow you want to meet your daughter after a long time, but u cant because youre in loop. After all enemies defeated, youre having a boss fight with Satan, or some kind of Devil. At the end, you cant defeat him (you will still fight in the boss fight), so youre dying on purpose, but your bravery convinces the God and all holy spirits to revive you. The curse is broken just as that. Youre going to meet your daughter blah blah.

## Game idea
Time loop

## Main character
single dad that has a daughter he loves with all of his heart. (mother died of cancer)

## Theme
Basically going thru hell. After you open the doors out of your home, you will end up in hell.

## Type
small open world, waves of enemies

## Style
Undertale, pixelart

## Conversations
monolog, dialog, text window on the bottom of the screen.

## Others
if you die once, character should be confused if he hasnt done this shit yet.

## View
2D, top-down


## Plan
- Wake up in the morning
- Objective: Have to go through all levels by the end of the day without dying
- Player will probably die or time out at least a few times before beating the game, need to balance
- Roguelike or roguelite?
- Boss fight at the last level, need to kill the boss, but it will not actually die
- Next morning meet with daughter back in the overworld
- Levels: start place is overworld, and as we go down each level is successively darker and more hellish
- Level elements:
  - Spawners
  - Specific spots where enemies spawn on level load
  - Some items on the ground
  - Item drops from enemies
  - Decorative stuff (crates, etc.)


- Either weapon damage is increased or you get some kind of buff
- Artificial restart points at end of certain levels
- Difficulty chooser at the menu
- Difficulty scales with game progress (enemies become harder and/or harder enemy types spawn)


## Ideas
- You plant a bomb or unlock a shortcut that pays off in future loops

## Questions
- How many levels?
- Draw sketch of the levels
- How many enemy types?
- Plan UI (health, weapon info, dialog box)
